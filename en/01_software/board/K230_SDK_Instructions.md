## 4. SDK compilation

### 4.1 Introduction to SDK compilation

The K230 SDK supports one-click compilation of large and little core operating systems and common components, and generates image files that can be programmed for deployment to the development board and start running. The username of the Linux system on the device is root without password;

### 4.2 SDK configuration

The K230 SDK uses Kconfig as the SDK configuration interface, and the board-level configuration supported by default is placed in the configs directory.

#### 4.2.1 Configuration File Description

`k230_evb_defconfig` : Default SDK profile based on K230 USIP LP3 EVB
`k230_evb_usiplpddr4_defconfig` : Default SDK profile based on K230 USIP LP4 EVB
`k230d_defconfig` : Default SDK profile based on K230-SIP-LP3-EVB
`k230_evb_nand_defconfig` : Based on the K230 USIP LP3 EVB, the default SDK configuration file of the nand image is generated
`k230_canmv_defconfig` : Default SDK configuration file based on CanMV-K230
`k230_evb_doorlock_defconfig` : Door lock poc default SDK profile based on K230 USIP LP3 EVB

`k230d_doorlock_defconfig` : Door lock POC based on K230-SIP-LP3-EVB

### 4.3 Compiling the SDK

#### 4.3.1 Compilation steps

Note: The commands in this section are for reference only, please replace the file name according to the actual situation.
Setp 1: Download the code

`git clone https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk`

Step 2: Enter the SDK root directory

`cd k230_sdk`

Step 3: Download toolchain

```shell
source tools/get_download_url.sh && make prepare_sourcecode
```

>`make prepare_sourcecode` will download both Linux and RT-Smart toolchain, buildroot package and AI package from Microsoft Azure cloud server with CDN, the download cost time may based on your network connection speed.

Step 4: Generate a docker image (required for the first compilation, skip this step after you have generated a docker image)

`docker build -f tools/docker/Dockerfile -t k230_docker tools/docker`

Step 5: Enter the docker environment,

`docker run -u root -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) -v $(pwd)/toolchain:/opt/toolchain -w $(pwd) k230_docker /bin/bash`

Step 6: Run the following command in the Docker environment to compile the SDK

```bash
make CONF=k230_evb_defconfig  #compile K230-USIP-LP3-EVB image
#make CONF=k230_evb_usiplpddr4_defconfig  #compile K230-USIP-LP4-EVB image
#make CONF=k230d_defconfig  #compile K230-SIP-LP3-EVB iamge
#make CONF=k230_evb_nand_defconfig  #compile K230-USIP-LP3-EVB nand image
```

> - Compile the K230-USIP-LP4-EVB board image using the`make CONF=k230_evb_usiplpddr4_defconfig` command
> - Compile the K230-USIP-LP3-EVB board image using the`make CONF=k230_evb_defconfig`  command.
> - Compile the K230-SIP-LP3-EVB board image using the`make CONF=k230d_defconfig`  command.

> - Compile the image of the CanMV-K230 board using the `make CONF=k230_canmv_defconfig`  command
>
> Remark:
The SDK does not support multi-process compilation, do not add multi-process compilation parameters like -j32.

#### 4.3.2 Compile the output product

After the compilation is complete, you `output/xx_defconfig/images`can see the compilation output in the directory. ls

![The Text description is automatically generated](../../../zh/01_software/board/images/da6d48091ee0af8107a63cde01a2b75b.png)

Figure 4-1 Compilation product

`images`The image files in the directory are described as follows:

`sysimage-sdcard.img` ------------- are non-secure boot images for SD and EMMC;

`sysimage-sdcard.img.gz` -------- is a non-secure boot image archive (gzip archive of sysimage-sdcard.img file) of SD and emmc, which needs to be decompressed first when burning.

`sysimage-sdcard_aes.img.gz`It is an AES Secure Boot image compressed package for SD and EMMC, and you need to decompress it before flashing.

`sysimage-sdcard_sm.img.gz`It is an SM Secure Boot image compressed package of SD and EMMC, and you need to decompress it first when burning.

If you need a security image, refer to 4.3.4 to enable secure images.

The compilation products of the big core system are placed in`images/big-core` the directory.

The compilation products of the little core system are placed in`images/little-core` the directory.

#### 4.3.3 can enter uboot command image

The SDK compiles the fast image by default (uboot directly starts the system, will not enter the uboot command line), if you need to enter the uboot command line, please refer to the following to unconfigure`CONFIG_QUICK_BOOT`:

In the SDK home directory , select `make menuconfig` and `board configuration`cancel`quick boot` the Configuration option.

enter uboot command image becomes fast starting system method: Enter uboot command line execution`setenv quick_boot true;saveenv;`

#### 4.3.4 Secure image

The SDK does not generate a secure image by default, if you need a secure image, refer to the following CONFIG_GEN_SECURITY_IMG configuration:

In the home directory of the SDK`make menuconfig`, select `board configuration`and attach`create security image` the option.

#### 4.3.5 debug images

The SDK generates a release image by default, if you need to debug the image, refer to the following CONFIG_BUILD_DEBUG_VER configuration:

In the home directory of the SDK`make menuconfig`, select `build debug/release version`and attach`debug` the option.

## 5. SDK image flashing

According to the hardware characteristics and software requirements of different motherboards, select the supported image programming method.
> The CanMV-K230 motherboard only supports SD card image boot.

### 5.1 SD card image flashing

The tools/menuconfig_to_code.sh script dynamically (the key scripts are below) modify the Linux device tree and board/common/gen_image_cfg/genimage-spinor .cfg files based on these definitions;

```bash
image sysimage-spinor32m.img {
    flash  {}
    flashtype = "spinor-32M-gd25lx256e"
    .....
    partition quick_boot_cfg {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_QUICK_BOOT_CFG_BASE}
        image = "${quick_boot_cfg_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_QUICK_BOOT_CFG_SIZE}
    }

    partition face_db {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_FACE_DB_CFG_BASE}
        image = "${face_database_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_FACE_DB_CFG_SIZE}
    }

    partition sensor_cfg {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SENSOR_CFG_CFG_BASE}
        image = "${sensor_cfg_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SENSOR_CFG_CFG_SIZE}
    }

    partition ai_mode {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_AI_MODE_CFG_BASE}
        image = "${ai_mode_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_AI_MODE_CFG_SIZE}
    }

    partition speckle_cfg {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SPECKLE_CFG_BASE}
        image = "${speckle_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_SPECKLE_CFG_SIZE}
    }

    partition rtt {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_RTTK_BASE}
        image = "big-core/rtt_system.bin"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_RTTK_SIZE}
    }
    partition rtt_app {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_RTT_APP_BASE}
        image = "${rtapp_data_file}"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_RTT_APP_SIZE}
    }

    partition linux {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_LK_BASE}
        image = "little-core/linux_system.bin"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_LK_SIZE}
    }
    partition rootfs_ubi {
        offset = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_LR_BASE}
        image = "rootfs.ubi"
        size = ${CONFIG_SPI_NOR_LR_SIZE}
    }
}
```

Finally, genimage parses the board/common/gen_image_cfg/genimage-spinor.cfg file and generates the correct image.

```bash
genimage --rootpath little-core/rootfs/ --tmppath genimage.tmp --inputpath images --outputpath images
--config board/common/gen_image_cfg/genimage-spinor.cfg
```

#### 6.1.3 Partition data format and generation process

At present, the data partitioned by parameters such as fast boot parameters, face data, sensor config, AI models, speckles, RTT, RTPp and other parameters are not encrypted, and the format and generation process are as follows:

![flash part data format](../../../zh/01_software/board/images/image-non_crypt.png)
The main build scripts are as follows:

```bsh
# For more detailed generation details, please read board/common/gen_image_script/gen_image_comm_func.sh file gen_cfg_part_bin
${k230_gzip} -f -k ${filename}  #gzip
sed -i -e "1s/\x08/\x09/"  ${filename}.gz
#add uboot head
${mkimage} -A riscv -O linux -T firmware -C gzip -a ${add} -e ${add} -n ${name}  -d ${filename}.gz  ${filename}.gzu;
python3  ${firmware_gen}   -i ${filename}.gzu -o fh_${filename} ${arg}; #add k230 firmware head

The corresponding execution process is printed as follows：
## + k230_priv_gzip -n8 -f -k speckle.bin
## + sed -i -e '1s/\x08/\x09/' speckle.bin.gz
## + mkimage -A riscv -O linux -T firmware -C gzip -a 0x14040000 -e 0x14040000 -n speckle -d speckle.bin.gz speckle.bin.gzu

```

When uboot starts, it will parse the data of the check parameter partition (fast start parameters, face characteristics, calibration parameters, AI model, speckle, RTT, RTAPP), and read the parsed raw data to the correct location in the memory.

The location of each parameter partition in memory can be configured by making menuconfig--memory configuration (the reference interface is as follows)

#### 6.1.4 RTAPP and AI Mode partitioning special instructions

The app of the RTAPP partition cannot be executed repeatedly, the purpose of designing this partition is to save memory, and the memory may be released after the application of this partition is executed once, and it cannot be executed repeatedly;

When compiling, the pointer to the model file in the large-core romfs file system will be modified to the AI model area (see the script below), and the use method is the same as a normal file.

```bash
#board/common/gen_image_script/gen_image.sh
for f in ${all_kmode};
    do
        eval fstart="\${${f%%\.*}_start}"
        eval fsize="\${${f%%\.*}_size}"
        fstart=$(printf "0x%x" $((${fstart} + ${CONFIG_MEM_AI_MODEL_BASE})))
        fsize=$(printf "0x%x" ${fsize})
        sed -i "s/_bin_$f,/(char*)${fstart},/g" ${RTSMART_SRC_DIR}/kernel/bsp/maix3/applications/romfs.c
        sed -i "s/sizeof(_bin_$f)/${fsize}/g" ${RTSMART_SRC_DIR}/kernel/bsp/maix3/applications/romfs.c
    done
```
